      <description>Undergraduate Capstone Polymerase Chain Reactions were conducted on several blood samples to distinguish between the Western Painted and Slider turtles without purifying samples. Crude blood samples were instrumented to demonstrate the efficacy of performing PCR analyses on products that have not been purified. Results show that crude blood samples can be used in placed of purified samples to run efficient polymerase chain reactions. Sufficient bands will form on electrophoresis gels with the crude samples.</description>
