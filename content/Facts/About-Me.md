# Personal Fascinations

I find great joy in the company of my friends and family, cherishing those close connections. My interests span a wide range, encompassing a love for science, mathematics, and data, as well as a creative side that comes alive through sketching, drawing, and painting.

Gaming is a significant part of my leisure time, with Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and DS being my platforms of choice. Strategic and fantastical board games also capture my attention, providing both entertainment and intellectual stimulation.

Nature holds a special place in my heart, and I frequently travel to Colorado with my family to immerse myself in the beauty of the mountains and trails. Hiking becomes not just a physical activity but a way to connect with the natural world and find moments of tranquility.
